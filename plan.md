# Detailed Implementation Plan for Jira Xray-like Application with Jira Integration

## 1. Project Setup and Environment
- Create a new Go project directory (e.g., "jira-xray-integration") in the root workspace.
- Initialize the Go module by running `go mod init jira-xray-integration`.
- Install required dependencies: Gin (for HTTP routing), godotenv (for environment variable management), and standard libraries for HTTP requests.

## 2. File: go.mod
- Create or update the go.mod file with the module name and dependencies:
  - Required modules: 
    - github.com/gin-gonic/gin (for REST API server)
    - github.com/joho/godotenv (for loading .env file)
- Ensure correct Go version (e.g., go 1.21) and run `go mod tidy` to fetch dependencies.

## 3. File: .env.sample
- Create a sample environment configuration file containing:
  - `JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`
  - `JIRA_USERNAME=demo_user`
  - `JIRA_API_TOKEN=demo_token`
  - `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=TEST`
- Include a note in the README instructing users to copy this file to a `.env` file and replace mock credentials with actual ones.

## 4. File: config.go
- Develop a configuration file that:
  - Uses godotenv to load variables from the `.env` file.
  - Defines a `Config` struct to hold `JiraBaseURL`, `JiraUsername`, `JiraAPIToken`, and `JiraProjectKey`.
  - Performs error handling to verify all required variables are set; if not, log the error and terminate.

## 5. Files in Directory: jira/
### a. File: jira/models.go
- Define Go structs to model Jira entities:
  - Create a `TestCase` struct with fields (e.g., ID, Summary, Description, Status).
  - Create a `TestExecution` struct with fields relevant to a test run (e.g., ID, TestIDs, ExecutionStatus).
  - Use proper JSON tags for request/response marshalling.
  
### b. File: jira/client.go
- Implement a Jira API client with functions:
  - `ListTestCases() ([]TestCase, error)`: Sends an HTTP GET request to retrieve test cases.
  - `CreateTestCase(tc *TestCase) (*TestCase, error)`: Sends an HTTP POST request to add a test case.
  - `CreateTestExecution(te *TestExecution) (*TestExecution, error)`: Sends an HTTP POST request to create a test execution record.
- Incorporate robust error handling (e.g., check HTTP status codes, log errors) and use basic authentication headers created from the mock credentials.

## 6. File: main.go
- Set up the main entry point to the application:
  - Load configuration via config.go.
  - Initialize the Gin router and apply middleware for logging and recovery.
  - Define RESTful endpoints:
    - **GET /api/testcases**: Calls `jira.ListTestCases()` and returns the list of test cases.
    - **POST /api/testcases**: Accepts JSON payload to create a new test case via `jira.CreateTestCase()`.
    - **POST /api/testexecutions**: Accepts JSON payload for a test execution record through `jira.CreateTestExecution()`.
  - Validate incoming JSON requests; return HTTP 400 for malformed requests.
  - Return appropriate HTTP statuses (e.g., 200, 201, 500) based on success or failure from the Jira client.

## 7. File: README.md (Update)
- Update the README.md to include:
  - Overview and purpose of the application.
  - Instructions for setting up the environment (copying .env.sample to .env and updating credentials).
  - Steps to run the server (`go run main.go`).
  - Example curl commands for testing each endpoint, e.g.:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/testcases
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/testcases -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"summary": "Sample Test", "description": "Test description"}'
    ```
- Explain error messages, logging approach, and how to extend endpoints in the future.

## 8. Error Handling, Logging & Best Practices
- In every function and API call, capture and handle errors; respond with meaningful messages.
- Log all failures and validation errors with details for easier debugging.
- Use middleware in Gin for recovery of panics and graceful error responses.

## 9. Testing and Curl Validation
- Provide testing instructions in README.md for using curl commands to verify:
  - JSON responses (using `jq` if necessary).
  - Proper HTTP status codes and error messages.
- Ensure sample commands cover both successful requests and error cases.

## 10. Future Enhancements and Security Considerations
- Plan to implement additional endpoints (e.g., update and delete test cases) as needed.
- Remind users to secure the `.env` file and not commit actual credentials to version control.
- Consider expanding error handling for network errors and response edge cases in production.

---

### Summary
- A new Go project ("jira-xray-integration") is set up with go.mod, using Gin and godotenv.
- A `.env.sample` file is created with mock Jira credentials; users must replace these with real values.
- The configuration is loaded in config.go, and Jira entity models are defined in jira/models.go.
- The Jira client (jira/client.go) implements functions to list, create test cases, and create test executions, with robust error handling.
- main.go initializes the API server with endpoints for test case and execution management.
- The README.md is updated with environment setup, run instructions, and curl testing commands.
- Best practices include comprehensive error handling, logging, and secure configuration management.
